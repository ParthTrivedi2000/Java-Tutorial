Problem Description:-
Given an array arr[ ] of n elements, the task is to find the next greater element for each element of the array in
order of their appearance in the array. Next greater element of an element in the array is the nearest element on the
right which is greater than the current element.
If there does not exist next greater of current element, then next greater element for current element is -1. For
example, next greater of the last element is always -1.

Examples
Input: arr[] = [1 3 2 4], n = 4
Output: 3 4 4 -1
Explanation: The next larger element to 1 is 3, 3 is 4, 2 is 4 and for 4, since it doesn't exist, it is -1.
Input: arr[] [6 8 0 1 3], n = 5
Output: 8 -1 1 3 -1
Explanation: The next larger element to 6 is 8, for 8 there is no larger elements hence it is -1, for 0 it is 1 ,
for 1 it is 3 and then for 3 there is no larger element on right and hence -1.
Input: arr[] [10, 20, 30, 50], n = 4
Output: 20 30 50 -1
Explanation: For a sorted array, the next element is next greater element also except for the last element.
Input: arr[] [50, 40, 30, 10], n = 4
Output: -1 -1 -1 -1
Explanation: For a reverse sorted array, the next greater element is always 1.

Expected Time Complexity : O(n)
Expected Auxiliary Space : O(n)

Constraints:
1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6
0 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^18
