Problem Description :-
You are given an m x n integer array grid where grid[i][j] could be:

1 representing the starting square. There is exactly one starting square.
2 representing the ending square. There is exactly one ending square.
0 representing empty squares we can walk over.
-1 representing obstacles that we cannot walk over.
Return the number of 4-directional walks from the starting square to the ending square, that walk over every
non-obstacle square exactly once.

Example 1:
Input: grid = [[1,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0],[0,0,2,-1]]
Output: 2
Explanation: We have the following two paths:
1. (0,0),(0,1),(0,2),(0,3),(1,3),(1,2),(1,1),(1,0),(2,0),(2,1),(2,2)
2. (0,0),(1,0),(2,0),(2,1),(1,1),(0,1),(0,2),(0,3),(1,3),(1,2),(2,2)
Example 2:
Input: grid = [[1,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,2]]
Output: 4
Explanation: We have the following four paths:
1. (0,0),(0,1),(0,2),(0,3),(1,3),(1,2),(1,1),(1,0),(2,0),(2,1),(2,2),(2,3)
2. (0,0),(0,1),(1,1),(1,0),(2,0),(2,1),(2,2),(1,2),(0,2),(0,3),(1,3),(2,3)
3. (0,0),(1,0),(2,0),(2,1),(2,2),(1,2),(1,1),(0,1),(0,2),(0,3),(1,3),(2,3)
4. (0,0),(1,0),(2,0),(2,1),(1,1),(0,1),(0,2),(0,3),(1,3),(1,2),(2,2),(2,3)
Example 3:
Input: grid = [[0,1],[2,0]]
Output: 0
Explanation: There is no path that walks over every empty square exactly once.
Note that the starting and ending square can be anywhere in the grid.

Constraints:
m == grid.length
n == grid[i].length
1 <= m, n <= 20
1 <= m * n <= 20
-1 <= grid[i][j] <= 2
There is exactly one starting cell and one ending cell.

/*
So this is the most standard question of backtracking.
Means actually there is starting point given & ending point given. We have to reach from starting point to ending
point on the grid. But on the grid, there are obstacles, and in that cell you can't go. And further this condition
makes question more interesting, Actually we have to return the number of paths to reach from source to destination
but by covering all the non obstacle cells on the grid vese number of paths return krne h.
