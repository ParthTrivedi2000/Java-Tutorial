/*
Problem Description :-
You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse
order, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.
You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

Example 1:
Input: l1 = [2,4,3], l2 = [5,6,4]
Output: [7,0,8]
Explanation: 342 + 465 = 807.
Example 2:
Input: l1 = [0], l2 = [0]
Output: [0]
Example 3:
Input: l1 = [9,9,9,9,9,9,9], l2 = [9,9,9,9]
Output: [8,9,9,9,0,0,0,1]

Constraints:
The number of nodes in each linked list is in the range [1, 100].
0 <= Node.val <= 9
It is guaranteed that the list represents a number that does not have leading zeros.

Problem Description :-

For example, num1 represented by the linked list : 1 -> 9 -> 0, similarly num2 represented by the linked
list: 2 -> 5. Sum of these two numbers is represented by 2 -> 1 -> 5.

Note: There can be leading zeros in the input lists, but there should not be any leading zeros in the output list.

Examples:
Input: num1 = 4 - > 5, num2 = 3 -> 4 -> 5
Output:  3 -> 9 -> 0
Explanation: Given numbers are 45 and 345. There sum is 390.
Input: num1 = 0 -> 0 -> 6 -> 3, num2 = 0 -> 7
Output: 7 -> 0
Explanation: Given numbers are 63 and 7. There sum is 70.
Constraints:
        1 <= size of both linked lists <= 10^6
        0 <= elements of both linked lists <= 9
