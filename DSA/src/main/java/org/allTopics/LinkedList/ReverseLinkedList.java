/* Q) Reverse a Linked List. head is given as an argument.
Problem Link:- https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list/
Problem Description :- Given the head of a singly linked list, reverse the list, and return the reversed list.
Exmaple:-
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [5,4,3,2,1]
Example 2:
Input: head = [1,2]
Output: [2,1]
Example 3:
Input: head = []
Output: []

Constraints:
The number of nodes in the list is the range [0, 5000].
-5000 <= Node.val <= 5000

    // Approach - 1:-
    // A very bruteforce approach I can think of is storing the LL elems to the
    // array and returning the reverse array by creating LL from array.
    // TC:- O(N), SC:-O(N)

    // Approach - 2:- Since Linked list is all about pointers ryt so why to store elems and all those things?
    // I mean simply we can just change the direction of each pointers, and we will be able to get the answer.
    // Time Complexity: O(n), Traversing over the linked list of size n.
    // Auxiliary Space: O(1)

    // we have to use the 3 pointers. prev, curr, next. bec somehow I want to point
    // out the next elem to the curr elem or I can say curr elem to the prev elem
    // ryt? so let's do it.

    public Node reverseList(Node head) {
        Node prev = null;
        Node curr = head;
        Node nextNode = null;
        while(curr!=null){
            nextNode = curr.next; //storing current elems address for future use.
            curr.next = prev; // now changing the curr elems pointer in reverse direction
            prev = curr;
            curr = nextNode; // using previously stored elem to move current pointer ahead
        }
        return prev;
    }



    // Follow up: A linked list can be reversed either iteratively or recursively. Could you implement both?
    // above we have seen the iterative solution. let's see the recursive code.

    // Approach - 3:- Recursive code.
    /* Follow the steps below to solve the problem:
     - Divide the list in two parts â€“ first node and rest of the linked list.
     - Call reverse for the rest of the linked list.
     - Link the rest linked list to first.
     - Fix head pointer to NULL.
     Time Complexity: O(n), visiting over every node one time.
     Auxiliary Space: O(n) , Function call stack space.

        // list

    /* The idea is to traverse the linked list and push all nodes except the last node into the stack. Make
     the last node as the new head of the reversed linked list. Now, start popping the element and append
     each node to the reversed Linked List. Finally, return the head of the reversed linked list.
