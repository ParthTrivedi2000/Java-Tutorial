Problem Description :-
Given an array arr[]  containing non-negative integers, the task is to divide it into two sets set1 and set2 such
that the absolute difference between their sums is minimum and find the minimum difference.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [1, 6, 11, 5]
Output: 1
Explanation:
Subset1 = {1, 5, 6}, sum of Subset1 = 12
Subset2 = {11}, sum of Subset2 = 11
Hence, minimum difference is 1.
Input: arr[] = [1, 4]
Output: 3
Explanation:
Subset1 = {1}, sum of Subset1 = 1
Subset2 = {4}, sum of Subset2 = 4
Hence, minimum difference is 3.
Input: arr[] = [1]
Output: 1
Explanation:
Subset1 = {1}, sum of Subset1 = 1
Subset2 = {}, sum of Subset2 = 0
Hence, minimum difference is 1.

Constraints:
1 ≤ arr.size()*|sum of array elements| ≤ 10^5
1 <= arr[i] <= 10^5

yrrr see, I am having one array. I have to perform the partition such that difference between 2 partitioned subset
should be minimum. Now means what could be the minimal idfference between any 2 numbers. 0 ryt?, so simply 1st
thought came in my mind is, suppose there is subset exists with sum=total/2, then we can say that this subset and
subset with remaining elems can be partitioned. But now what if sum=total/2 doesn't exists? so obviously we will try
to find the subsets with sums such that difference between the sum of them would be 1. means just mean to say that

s2 - s1 = 0
but we know s1+s2 = total => s2 = total-s1
total-s1-s1=0
total-2*s1 = 0 => but since we are not sure that there exists sum with total/2 so we can say that we want to have
sum s1 such that above condition stays as nearest to zero. ==> total-2*s1>=0 => total>=2*s1 => total/2>=s1

So now from above discussion we are sre that we need to have that subset sum which is exactly total/2 or if not then
we can say as close as possible ryt?

Now see as per the subset sum question, we know the dp table we are creating, in that table what each cell is
representing? --> dp[i][j] --> maximum possible subset such that sum=j with first i elems.
So now just see the dp talbe's last line. what it will represent. It actually represents like by considering
all the given elements will you be able to make sum 0,1,2,3,4.... or not if yes, it has shown as true.
