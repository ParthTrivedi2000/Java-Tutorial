Types of Design Patterns:-
Note:- Again stating that, Desing Patterns are nothing but idea. Implementation is up to you, I mean
how to implement that idea is up to the developer. So Design patterns helps to implement it in structured
manner. but it's not mandate to use design patterns (saying this just to clarify in mind, it's not mandate
but good if you implement it in your code).

Creational Design Patterns:-
- from the name itself, it's self understood, these patterns are related to how Objects should be created
while developing software.
- example:- Singletone Design Pattern, Factory Design Patter etc etc...

Structural Design Patterns:-
- Again from the name itself it is understood, like these are the patterns which helps to structurise
your code as software has hell lot classes and objects. so basically these patterns helps/ideates how
classes and objects structured to have it minimal as well as provides all the functionalities we want as
a user.
- example :-

Behavioural Design Patterns:-
- These patterns are providing insights, how Objects should communicate/interact with each other, how services
