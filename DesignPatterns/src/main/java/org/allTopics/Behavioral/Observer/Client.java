Walmart LLD Round - 3:- Question :-
If you have visited Amazon.com website, you can search for any product, for example iphone. Now for example
iphone is not available right now. So you have been shown Notify Me button. So once iPhone is available in stock
all the users who pressed Notify Me button have been notified via email. This is the functionality.
So you have to implement this Notify Me button functionality.
