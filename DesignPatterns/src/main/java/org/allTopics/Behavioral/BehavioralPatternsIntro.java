so creational design patterns are concerned with how objects should be created and different/ better ways to
to create objects. while structural design patterns is all about, how different classes should be structured in
our project for smooth working with each other.
while behavioral design patterns are all about how our classes should do the things or doing certain actions or like
how codebase should be structured such that they work very well.
